A Python based simplified Graphical User Interface (named PHREI) was created with the abilities of a previously developed and published geochemical model setup [Markó, Á., Brehme, M., Pedretti, D., Zimmermann, G., & Huenges, E. (2024). Controls of low injectivity caused by interaction of reservoir and clogging processes in a sedimentary geothermal aquifer (Mezőberény, Hungary). Geothermal Energy, 12(1), 40.].

The setup aims to reproduce the main geochemical processes of a geothermal loop from production until reinjection into the aquifer. The forming scale cumulated over time is then used to estimate the porosity and permeability degradation in the near-wellbore zone. 

PHREI is applicable without creating new hydrogeochemical model setups by entering the parameters in pop-up windows: fluid composition of production well and reservoir fluid, mineral composition of the reservoir, flow rate, initial porosity and dimensions of gravel pack or the near well-bore zone, reinjection and reservoir temperature. Outcome of the model provides first estimate of clogging risk in doublet systems, as an example a theoretical period of time in which porosity is decreased by half.

Improvements in the code are included regularly.
